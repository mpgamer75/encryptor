# ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL FIX - Options 2 & 3 Now Work!

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: When selecting options 2 (Encrypt) or 3 (Decrypt), nothing appeared on screen - just a waiting cursor.

**Root Cause**: The functions `select_file_interactive()` and `select_algorithm_menu()` were being called with command substitution `$()`, which captured ALL their output (including the menu displays) into a variable. This meant:
- User saw NOTHING on screen
- Menu was being captured silently
- Script appeared frozen

## Solution Applied

**Redirected all display output to stderr (`>&2`)**:
- Messages now go to stderr (visible on screen)
- Only the final result (filename or algorithm) goes to stdout (captured by `$()`)
- User can now see menus and prompts!

### Files Modified

**`encryptor/encryptor.sh`**:

1. **`select_file_interactive()` function** (lines 199-239):
   - Added `>&2` to all `echo` statements
   - Added `>&2` to `print_section_header`
   - Only the selected filename goes to stdout

2. **`select_algorithm_menu()` function** (lines 253-302):
   - Added `>&2` to all display output
   - Only the selected algorithm goes to stdout

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
```bash
file=$(select_file_interactive "File:")
# ALL output captured â†’ user sees NOTHING
```

### After (Fixed):
```bash
file=$(select_file_interactive "File:")
# Display â†’ stderr (visible)
# Result â†’ stdout (captured in variable)
```

## Test This Now!

```bash
bash encryptor.sh

# Choose 2 (Encrypt)
# You should NOW see:
# - ":: File Selector ::"
# - List of files with numbers
# - Prompt: "File to encrypt:"

# Then:
# - ":: Select Encryption Algorithm ::"
# - List of algorithms
# - Password prompts
# - Success report!
```

## Expected Behavior

### Option 2 - Encrypt
1. Shows file selector with numbered list
2. Shows algorithm selector with descriptions
3. Prompts for password
4. Shows encryption progress
5. Displays success report with file created

### Option 3 - Decrypt
1. Shows file selector for encrypted files
2. Shows algorithm selector
3. Prompts for password
4. Shows decryption progress
5. Displays success report

## Technical Details

### Stderr vs Stdout
- **Stdout** (`echo "text"`): Captured by `$(command)`
- **Stderr** (`echo "text" >&2`): Always visible, not captured

### Why This Pattern?
Functions that both:
1. Display menus (interactive)
2. Return values (via echo)

Must separate concerns:
- Interactive display â†’ stderr (`>&2`)
- Return values â†’ stdout (regular `echo`)

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Options 2 & 3 now fully functional!

Test immediately on Linux to confirm!
